              Welcome to my page. You have taken the first step toward Personal Transformation. My focus and passion are helping women who are at a pivotal place in their lives; a crossroad, whether that be a separation in a relationship, empty nest syndrome, feeling lost, or more importantly, a desire to prioritize yourself and discover your life purpose.

            <p>
              I live life guided by this quote, as it highlights the urgency to live life with purpose. Additionally, this quote also has a profound impact on the way we think because once you realize your time on this earth is limited, especially as you approach middle age, it reminds you to consciously prioritize the way you live each day of your life.

            </p>
            <p>
              Once you are aware that your time here is limited and you only have a limited amount of time to do the things you’ve always wanted to do or evolve into the person you’ve always envisioned yourself to become, a major unstoppable shift will occur for you.

            <p>
              Hello, my name is Christine. I have always been a student of life. But my deep dive into my life's purpose began in my 50's.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have experienced my fair share of adversity: death, divorce, relocation, and so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story that I want to share began in my 40’s. That is when I met the man I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. I was happy and deeply in love.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few years later, I began to think: what now? That is when I took action and set up a studio in my home where I practiced my passion of esthetics. My clientele began to grow and soon after the opportunity to train other estheticians presented itself. I had finally found my calling for teaching and mentoring other women. But there was still something missing. As I delved deeper into myself, I realized I still wasn’t living life to my fullest potential. I wanted more. I loved my career in esthetics, but on a cellular level I knew there was something more for me to tap into, but what? 
            </p>
            <p>
              And then, after 8 years, without warning my prince charming ended our union. This broke my heart and quite literally rocked my world.
            </p>
            <p>
              My focus suddenly shifted toward healing a healing that would be the biggest I had ever experienced. Although this was a tumultuous time for me, the split propelled me into an even deeper path of self-discovery. Therapy, journaling, friends, and a multitude of spiritual practices carried me through this uncertain time.
            </p>

            <p>Miraculously, my life's path came to light after a trip to Hawaii for a HUNA Energy Training. It was there that the former Christine "died" figuratively speaking. I realized the former me, the person that I was, and the life behind me no longer served my soul. I was gifted a clean slate; a breath of a new life blew inside of me. I was reborn and began the process of creating a new life.</p>
               
            <p>Astrology became yet another passion. As I started to read birth charts for my clients, I discovered yet another layer of gifts that had been lying dormant. Astrology gave me the opportunity to begin the process of coaching, which propelled me to my purpose of helping people find out "Who they authentically are" and what they want out of life, at any age. I continued pursuing an education in personal growth and development, so I am able to help YOU grow and live your best life. I am here as a testament and invested partner who wants to guide you through what is calling you, while reminding you that it is NEVER too late to reclaim who you truly are and wish to be.</p>  

            <p>As a person of integrity, my studies and certifications were carefully selected to give you the utmost of care. I look forward to being a part of your journey.</p>

Your Astrological Birth Chart maps out all areas in life and describes your "nature" and your karma in this lifetime. Was your childhood troubled? Are you a go-getter in your career? Do you have trouble in relationships? Are you impulsive? Anxious? A great communicator? A student of life? What is your destiny? Your natal chart will reveal it all! I will discuss the positives and how they can be enhanced, as well as point out any challenges so you can begin to focus and work on them.

                      What is happening right now? What areas of your life are being highlighted?  All of these questions can be answered by looking at where the planets are "traveling" through your natal chart now and in the upcoming year. A transit chart reading is invaluable for planning the year ahead. What is your focus? Is it planetarily supported? Questions that we can focus on are Self, Finances, Family, Real Estate, Communication, Children, Work, Relationships, Education, Career, Friends, and Mental Health and more.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Past life regression therapy is an interactive process that accesses the deep subconscious, higher mind and soul memories. These memories contain valuable information as to your core beliefs, emotions, feelings and even physical past. What you carry with you from past incarnations has a direct influence on your present state. Chronic or unexplained pain, fears, phobias, or even an intense attachment to another person all may be related to your past. Your soul carries with it key moments and events that then form your karma. All the answers are locked inside and may have been carried over. 
                  <h6 class="mt-3">How Does Past Life Regression Hypnosis Work?</h6>
                  <p>All hypnosis is self-hypnosis. It is a state of hyper-focus. During your session you will be relaxed and in control. You will focus on my voice and allow all other sounds and distractions to recede. I will ask many questions and together we will go on a journey. Clients can experience a past life regression in many ways. Some people simply have a sense of "knowing" the details of a previous lifetime. Other people experience very vivid visual details, while some even experience sounds, smells and physical sensations. Memory and imagination come from the same place; the healing is real.</p>

                  <p>A Personal MER Breakthrough Session is a 8--10 hour NLP Session that is spaced over a few days. A BTS is designed to work on an entire area of life to eliminate all that is holding you back and creates momentum, motivation and success! Areas of concentration are Relationships, Family, Career, Health & Fitness, Personal Growth & Development and Spirituality. The purpose of a BTS is to discover the "Greater Problem", the "Root Cause", the "Block" that is holding you back. Once discovered, we release what is no longer serving you by working with all layers of the mind with MER: Mental Emotional Release Timeline Therapy. When you transform one area of life, the positive results trickle down to others! A NLP Personal Breakthrough Session is quite literally the most transformative thing you will ever do in your life.</p>

                  <p>During the Breakthrough Session we will:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Go through a <em>Detailed Personal History</em> process to discover root causes: the roots that are causing challenges</li>
                    <li>Elicit <em>Values</em> and positive outcomes</li>
                    <li>Get rid of any <em>Negative Emotions, Limiting Beliefs, Emotional Baggage and Anxiety</em> using MER (Emotional Mental Release)</li>
                    <li>Utilize any <em>NLP Techniques</em> to achieve the most positive outcomes</li>

              <p>I had the pleasure of having my astrological chart completed and read by the best astrologer I've ever come across, and I've had my chart done numerous times. What made it the best was the time Christine took to go over each article and house as well as the meanings, and how it applied to me personally. This is a rarity. At the end, she did a quick synopsis of what we went over and asked if there were any questions. She was so thorough I could not think of one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</p>

              <p>Working with Christine was a big turning point for me in my grief journey. She facilitated an MER breakthrough session, which enabled me to heal with more ease, release limiting beliefs, and flourish in my new business and in my relationships. Christine's compassion is unmatched and her knowledge of techniques to facilitate transformation and growth is extensive. I am so grateful to have worked with Christine at a vulnerable time in my life with grief and loss.</p>

              <p>I had the pleasure of having my astrological chart read by Christine Byrnes. Let’s just say I was blown away by the accuracy of my life and experiences. Christine patiently explained every detail in each house and how it all applied to me specifically. Christine was personable, patient, and flawless in her presentation. What an amazing experience!</p>

              <p>If you ever wondered why, you developed certain narratives about who you are, give past life regression a try. My experience with Christine Byrnes brought to light many of the answers I searched for, but never imagined I could resolve. It’s an incredibly comfortable journey though some uncomfortable experiences. She is skilled and caring. She listens and processes every word with an insight that comes from not only education, but an innate ability to delve into the mind and heart of her clients. Take it from a skeptic, an eye opening you won’t soon forget.</p>

            <p>NLP or Neuro Linguistic Programming is a collection of tools and techniques that are used to create significant and lasting changes in people in a short period of time. NLP is typically used within coaching sessions as questions, exercises, and visualizations that can completely change the way someone thinks and behaves.</p>

            <p>NLP is essentially a study of the connection between the neurological processes ("neuro"), language ("linguistic") and behavioral patterns learned through experience ("programming") and as such, these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. All sessions are designed to create rapport and trust, so that you feel comfortable to open up and express what is really going on. NLP clients gain clarity for what they truly want and develop clear and concise goals that support their outcomes.</p>

            <p>NLP can be used to establish empowering states of mind and to overcome any limiting beliefs, conflicts, and bad habits. It also can be used to break free of cravings or dislike your favorite junk food!</p>

            <p>NLP will help to:  
              <ul>
                <li>Reduce limiting beliefs and habits, replacing them with empowering ones</li>
                <li>Be freed from the stress and worry of past negative experiences </li>
                <li>Be more understanding of differences and enrich relationships with others </li>
                <li>Feel more resourceful even in challenging situations </li>
                <li>Enhance self-appreciation and self- esteem </li>
                <li>Set appropriate, achievable goals to motivate you to know the path you wish to take in life and to plan your journey effectively </li>

The result is a collection of techniques which produces long-lasting transformation very quickly-faster than what is currently called Brief Therapy. These powerful MER techniques are becoming the method of choice to make fast, effective, long-term changes in behavior.
